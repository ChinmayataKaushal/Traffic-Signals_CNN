This is a CNN i.e., Convolutional Neural Network model that classifies various traffic signals into 43 classes with an accuracy of 90+ percentile.

I have uploaded the model (.h5 file), the python code for the model (.py file) as well as the datset (both training and test data seperately). You can simply clone the git repository and you will have everything necessary to work with the model.
